## Prompt:

In 2009 one of the associate editors of Biostatistics, Roger Peng, outlined a new policy of [reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014) for the journal. 

This triggered a response from one of the other associated editors, Niels Keiding, and subsequently a large part of volume 11, issue 3 of Biostatistics was dedicated to a discussion of issues of redproducibility. 


Read through 

- Roger Peng's [initial editorial](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014), 

- [Keiding's response](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033),

- its five [commentaries](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/issue/11/3),  

- Roger Peng's [response to Keiding](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq032)

- and finally, Keiding's [response to the commentaries](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq034)

Don't worry about the number of papers listed - these papers are all very short and easy reads. 


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on dta related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
